# Theory
Humans do not posses all of the neccessary information to be 100% correct in knowing which way a stock will swing. Unless a person has insider information in a fair market it takes a lot of fundamental and technical analysis to make a good estimate of the stocks future. This program is to test a theory that stocks movement is random and a random selection of stocks should net a net 0 income over a long time (this is technically untrue because there is a historic tendency for stock prices to rise as economy and social policies improve and technologies become better so more product is created with less manpower).

So in essence a better way to make a profit is to react to a stock price swings in a correct way. This program is ment to test a simple theory - no matter what way a stock swings a correct response will mitigate damage and increase profit.

Alpha Vantage will be used to collect stock data

# Rules
For the first iteration the program will have two simple rules to test the aformentioned theory:
 - If a stock loses 10% of its original investment it is sold. In first tests the stock will be sold for most of its original value. Later on the sell price will be adjusted to match the real life average devaluation.
 - A stock is held until it is rising and is only sold if the price drops 10% of its highest price while being held. 
To make a fair test these all stocks will be bought for the same amount or as close as possible to the same amount. Also all stocks will be sold at a specific day count if they remain profitable. 

These rules should net a profit because succesfull stocks are hold on too for a long time while unsuccessfull stocks are sold as soon as possible. 

# Scenarios
For testing purposes a huge amount of stock will be bought and sold. Later on more realistic scenarious will be checked as the main goal of this experiment is to make a real life profit. So best case scenarious will be sougth after.

# Pseudo logic
- Stock data will be parsed and all of the available stocks will be found.
- A random stock will be selected and a set amount worth of stock will be "bought" at a random date, atleast 100 days until current date.
- Every day the stock price will be checked to see if the any of the rules are matched. If there is a match then the rule is executed and another stock will be tried.
- A result of profit is recorded and accumulated for the duration of the test.
- Profit is displayed.

# Future improvements
- Better stock selection algorithm - ala The Little Book That Beats the Market.
- Better buying and selling logic.
- Using different inventing tools - derivatives.

# Programming goals
- OpenGL or Vulcan display.
- Extensive use of classes and patterns as an exercise.
- C# or C++ as a way to practise and improve in a more popular and more "complete" language.
- Performance programing (only really possible with C, C++ and Rust)
- Reinvent the wheel in all the possible ways.
- Maybe in the future use AI. It is a already explored area, but it might still be useful to to try and build upon it.
- TTD.
- Some planing and diagrams to make the project more concise and "proffesionnal".
- Clean code.
- Multithreading.
